										<h2>NBA <strong>The Hall Of Fame</strong></h2>
									</header>
									<h3>Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame</h3>
									<p>The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame is a museam
									located in Springfield, Massachusets. This museam is also an Hall
									of Fame for all of basketball, awarding those who have shown massive
									contributions to basketball. Although coaches, referees, and anyone
									else who has had a major effect on the game can be placed in the
									Hall of Fame, we will only be examining the player category. in
									order to be a player placed in the Basketball Hall of Fame, one
									must have been retired for three years and have had a winshare (a
									value representing contribution to wins) of at least 50.</p>

									<h3>Our Dataset</h3>
									<p>For our main dataset, we chose to use a dataset on Kaggle containing
									player personal data along with performances every season including the
									variables below:
									<br>
									<br><b>Total Points</b>: Total number of points scored over their career
									<br><b>Win Share</b>: Each win is worth 3 points. Player are given a
									part of the 3 points depending on the amount they contributed to that game.
									Win Share is cumulative.
									<br><b>Offensive Win Share</b>: Win Share considering only offensive plays.
									<br><b>Defensive Win Share</b>: Win Share considering only defensive plays.
									<br><b>Win Share/ 48 mins</b>: Average Win Share for 48 minutes played
									<br><b>Player Effeciency Rating</b>: A score that predicts player Effeciency
									using other statisitics
									<br><b>Basketball Box Score-Based Metric</b>: A rating dependent on number
									of points scored over the average per 100 plays
									<br><b>Offensive Basketball Box Score-Based Metric</b>: The same rating as
									above but only dependent on offensive plays
									<br><b>RPG</b>: Rebounds per game
									<br><b>SPG</b>: Steals per game
									<br><b>APG</b>: Assists per game
									<br><b>BPG</b>: Blocks per game

									<br><br>
									Along with these variables were other variables including number of championships,
									free point percentage,and three point percentage. However,we had decided that due
									to the incredibly weak coorelation between those variables and Hall of Fame, we
									would choose to stay away from considering them.

									The dataset contained data from 1950 to 2017 but we choose to only examine data
									beginning from 1977 due to extremly limited data starting from 1950 and the use
									use of exactly four decades. Although this data set is not perfect, lacking crucial
									data about major players who have shown up in the past 7 years, it is still contains
									a plethora of data.
									</p>
									</nav>

									<h3> The Goal </h3>
									<p>Our goal was to simply use the variables we could to do two major tasks. First
									we wanted to predict who would likely, post retirement, be entered into the Hall
									of Fame. Secondly, we wanted to find underrated players who have shown excellence
									in the games where they have been played but who have simply failed to have
									played in the number of games that would allow for them to have things such as
									high winshare.</p>
