										<h2>NBA <strong>The Hall Of Fame</strong></h2>
									</header>
									<h3>Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame</h3>
									<p>The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame is a museam
									located in Springfield, Massachusets. This museam is also an Hall
									of Fame for all of basketball, awarding those who have shown massive
									contributions to basketball. Although coaches, referees, and anyone
									else who has had a major effect on the game can be placed in the
									Hall of Fame, we will only be examining the player category. in
									order to be a player placed in the Basketball Hall of Fame, one
									must have been retired for three years.</p>

									<h3>Our Dataset</h3>
									<p>Our main dataset was taken off of basketball-refernce.com
										and contained individual player per game per season data From
										1950 - 2022. For the sake of our analysis, we broke up the data
										in such a way that we had stats for each player's year 1 and
										year 2. This way, we could create a prediction algorithm based
										for future candidates without first seeing their lifetime
										achievements.

									<h3> The Goal </h3>
									<p>The NBA Hall of Fame is somewhat shrouded in mystery.
									Although we know that Hall of Famers are chosen for good
									reasons, it would be nice to have objective way to see which
									players will have the ability to one day make it into the Hall
									of Fame. Along with just wanting, for the sake of knowledge, to know
									who the best players are or potentially will be, there is
									also an incentive for brands to know who the next big player
									in order to make the brand deals before other brands try to
									take over. </p>
