							<h3>What we did!</h3>
							<p>We had set out with one goal in mind. To find out who could,
							in the near future, join the Basketball Hall of Fame by examining
							players in the NBA. After cleaning up the data, we created two
							simple models to determine who could join, both of which can
							be found in the bottom section of our code page. The first model
							took into account who, using statistics taken in 2017, could have
							already joined the Hall of Fame given accomplishments completed.
							The second model looked for performance on a per game or per time
							basis rather that overall achievements to see who could join the
							Hall of Fame in the future. The results show that although many
							known names are set to fit straight into the Hall of Fame, names
							that gained popularity after 2017 show up in the second model!</p>
							<h3>Considerations We Took</h3>
							<p>Perhaps most important was our decision to go with a random forest.
							Perhaps we should have swapped away from random forest as went deeper
							in but initially, we had been working with many seperate variables
							so the best way forward was with a random forest. When we finally
							did decide to focus down specific variables, we chose to remove variables
							that would be clearly dependent on other variables. For example, Player
							Effeciciency Rating was already a combination of other variables so using
							it along with the other variables would only confuse the function more.
							In the end, we decided to look at overall performance and per game/time performace
							to judge both who had already had the largest impact on the game and who
							could become a major impact in the near future.</p>
							<h3>Was it perfect?</h3>
							<p>Our actual model is truly far from perfect. First, we did do some
							data erasing due to unknown values. Additionally, it can be said that
							the size of our data set is actually quite small. From our Kaggle
							data, we found more then 4000 players. However, of all of the people
							in the Basketball Hall of Fame, only 177 of them were players and out
							of the 177, only 110 were from the NBA. If you take into account the
							fact we split the set yet again in order to test our model, the amount
							of Hall of Fame players in both the training set and testing set
							were quite small in number. Additionally, it is important to note that
							our data we used to create our model was composed of data from  1977-1997 and the data we were
							experimenting with was data from 1997-2017. Over the course of those years
							the game had changed. However, using anyone who has retired in the
							most recent 20 years or are still in the game for training the model
							would also be unfair because it is still possible for those players
							to be inducted into the Hall of Fame.</p>
