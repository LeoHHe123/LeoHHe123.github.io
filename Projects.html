											<h3>Sibley Memorial Hospital</h3>
										</header>
										<p>I volunteered at Sibley Memorial Hospital for the summer of 2018 and 2019. I volunteered in multiple
										places including the Surgery department and the front desk but actually spent the majority of the time
										in the Emergency Room where I communicated with patients, prepared beds, and helped stock rooms.</p>

											<h3>NIST MML Department</h3>

										<p>I worked as a High School Intern at Nist in the SHIP program. I worked under Dr. Feng Yi of the Materials
										Measurements Science Division of the Material Measurements Lab and helped to program the vacuums for the
										picocalorimeter using a programming language named labview. I also worked on a project related to calculating
										released heat from bacteria using a nanocalorimeter.</p>

											<h3>Cabin John Middle School</h3>
										</header>
										<p>I worked as a coach for a math team at Cabin John Middle School. We would meet every Saturday and
										I would try to teach them various forms of mathematics and prepare them for a middle school math competition
										called Mathcounts. The team managed to land 7th place in our county and 9th place in state, pretty good considering
										it was the first year they participated</p>
